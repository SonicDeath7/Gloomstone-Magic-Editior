## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨  This is a simple graphic editor for creating covers of black metal and dungeon synth bands. For now the interface is very primitive, but improvements are planned in the future. âœ¨ 

What's available now:

- ðŸ”­ Several filters to choose from
- ðŸŒ± You can play music in the background to immerse yourself in the dungeon synth atmosphere by pressing the "Toggle Music" button
- ðŸ‘¯ Different image settings 1) Brightness 2) Contrast 3) Pixelation 4) Saturation
- ðŸ¤” The image can be saved in PNG format


âœ¨ This is an early access project. Write your wishes and suggestions for improving the project. You can make it better with me. âœ¨
